AutoDraft.AI is an intelligent web app that transforms any engineering idea into a complete, build-ready plan — from concept and CAD design to circuitry, manufacturing, and marketing.

AutoDraft.AI is a collaborative web application that helps users turn their engineering ideas into reality. Simply describe a product you want to build — like an RC airplane, a robotic arm, or a smart irrigation system — and AutoDraft.AI will generate a comprehensive blueprint that includes:

🧠 Concept Breakdown: Technical feasibility analysis and design approach

⚙️ Circuit & System Diagrams: Schematics and component recommendations

🧩 3D CAD Design Guidance: CAD models and mechanical layout suggestions

🛠️ Build & Assembly Instructions: Step-by-step directions for prototyping and testing

💼 Presentation & Marketing Insights: How to present, package, and promote your product

Built by a team of engineering students, AutoDraft.AI aims to bridge the gap between idea and implementation, empowering anyone — from hobbyists to engineers — to design and prototype complex products with confidence.
